"""Interactive selector — domain contract.

Hexagonal split: this module is the *port*. The terminal-side implementation
(prompt_toolkit, curses, fakes for tests) lives under
``deile/infrastructure/selectors/``. Domain code MUST depend on this module
only, never on the adapter.

Consumers obtain a concrete selector via :func:`get_default_selector`. Tests
inject fakes implementing :class:`InteractiveSelector` directly.
